Lip-Reading-On-Image-Data<br>

This project presents a CNN + GRU model for lip reading, aiming to bridge the gap between lip movements and spoken language transcription. Leveraging a diverse dataset acquired through Kaggle, the model underwent rigorous data preprocessing, including augmentation and normalization. Its architecture, comprising convolutional and recurrent layers, effectively captured both spatial and temporal features/.
